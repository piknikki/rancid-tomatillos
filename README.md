# Rancid Tomatillos
A small movie app that displays all movies pulled in from an API, and upon clicking, shows that movie's profile. 

Team Members:  Nikki Petersen as solo developer [My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/piknikki)

Learning goals:  To refresh myself on React, implementing RESTful APIs along the way, and learning 
(or at least getting an introduction to) Cypress to test the user flows. 

Evolution of the project:  This project flowed according to the project specs, but I also refactored 
along the way whenever I saw a better way to do something or when I received feedback on how to DRY up my 
code. I deployed immediately to Heroku so that I didn't have to worry about it at the end of the project 
time. 

As far as other extensions, I looked into this article -- 
[Medium article on Redux and Hooks](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/do-react-hooks-replace-redux-210bab340672) -- 
when considering whether to implement Redux. For the most part, most of the power of Redux would go unrealized because this 
project is so small, so I decided to stick with some small hook usage to work through issues of state and timing of 
the data calls.
